    Perform Picard iteration to find solution to the Grad-Shafranov equation

    eq       - an Equilibrium object (equilibrium.py)
    profiles - A Profile object for toroidal current (jtor.py)

    rtol     - Relative tolerance (change in psi)/( max(psi) - min(psi) )
    atol     - Absolute tolerance, change in psi
    blend    - Blending of previous and next psi solution
               psi{n+1} <- psi{n+1} * (1-blend) + blend * psi{n}

    show     - If true, plot the plasma equilibrium at each nonlinear step
    axis     - Specify a figure to plot onto. Default (None) creates a new figure
    pause    - Delay between output plots. If negative, waits for window to be closed

    maxits   - Maximum number of iterations. Set to None for no limit.
               If this limit is exceeded then a RuntimeError is raised.

    convergenceInfo - True/False toggle for outputting convergence data.

    check_limited - True/False toggle to control checking for limited plasmas.
    wait_for_limited - True/False toggle to keep iterating until the plasma is limited.
    limit_it - Integer > Sometimes waiting some number of interations before checking if
    a plasma is limited can improve convergence. This sets the number of iterations to wait.

class MultiCoil(Coil):
    """
    This class is multifunctional and can model several coil arrangements:

    1. A single PF coil
    2. A block of several PF coil filaments, modelled as
        a. a single point in (R,Z)
        b. a list of (R,Z) points for each filament in the block

    In both cases, the specified coil(s) can also be mirrored in Z=0 and
    connected in a circuit sharing the same power supply. In such a case,
    there is also the option to specify the polarity of the currents in
    the upper and lower coil blocks, enabling the wiring of these blocks
    in opposite directions.

        Area can be a fixed value (e.g. 0.025 for 5x5cm coil), or can be specified
        using a function which takes a coil as an input argument.
        To specify a current density limit, use:

            area = AreaCurrentLimit(current_density)

        where current_density is in A/m^2. The area of the coil will be recalculated
        as the coil current is changed.

        The most important effect of the area is on the coil self-force:
        The smaller the area the larger the hoop force for a given current.

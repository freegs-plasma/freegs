This Python module calculates plasma equilibria for tokamak fusion experiments,
by solving the Grad-Shafranov equation with free boundaries. Given a set of coils,
plasma profiles and shape, FreeGS finds the currents in the coils which produce
a steady-state solution in force balance.

**Note** This is a work in progress, and probably contains bugs. 
There is a feature wishlist in issues, suggestions and contributions welcome!

Installing
----------

FreeGS is available on PyPI 

    $ pip install --user freegs

or clone/download this repository and run setup:

    $ git clone https://github.com/freegs-plasma/freegs.git
    $ cd freegs
    $ python setup.py install --user

Documentation
-------------

The manual is in the `docs` subdirectory, and [hosted here on readthedocs](http://freegs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

Testing
-------

Unit tests use [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) so after installing, run with:

    $ pytest

The tests are in the `src/` subdirectory.

A convergence test is [described in the manual](https://freegs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tests.html#convergence-test). To run:

    $ python test-convergence.py

Examples
--------

The Jupyter notebooks contain examples wuth additional notes


* [tutorial.ipynb](./tutorial.ipynb)

Launch tutorial in [![MyBinder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/freegs-plasma/freegs/tutorial?labpath=tutorial.ipynb)

* MAST-example.ipynb 

There are also some Python scripts to run short tests
and examples

    $ python 01-freeboundary.py

This solves a free boundary problem, specifying the desired location of two X-points.
Writes the equilibrium to a G-EQDSK file "lsn.geqdsk"

    $ python 02-read-geqdsk.py

Reads in the file "lsn.geqdsk", inferring the coil currents from the plasma boundary
and profiles in the G-EQDSK file.

    $ python 03-mast.py

Calculates a double-null (CDND) equilibrium for MAST from scratch. Writes solution to
G-EQDSK file "mast.geqdsk"

    $ python 04-read-mast-geqdsk.py

Reads the file "mast.geqdsk", inferring the coil currents.

    $ python 05-fixed-boundary.py 

This example solves a fixed boundary problem, in which the square edges of the domain
are fixed. The plasma pressure on axis and plasma current are fixed.

    $ python 06-xpoints.py

This demonstrates the coil current control code, finding X-points, and marking core region
These routines are used inside the free boundary solver
